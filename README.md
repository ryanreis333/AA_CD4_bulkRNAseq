# AA_CD4_bulkRNAseq
#
## This is a repository for the analysis of bulk RNA seq from AA and UA mice. All cells were flow sorted CD4+ before sequencing, and contain  effector, naive, and regulatory cell types.

### Analysis reveals that AA and UA samples are seperable via PC1, and we can vizualize the expression differences of the top up and down-regulated genes as a functions of padj values.
